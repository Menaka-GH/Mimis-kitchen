		6. Snack Recipes

if you click one of the link in the above list of categories, it will take to the separate list of recipes.

Recipes
-------
	In the "Recipes" link, I have included all the categories by picture representation with the hyperlink.
when you press each picture, it will take you to that category list of recipes.  
For example, if you click the picture under "Breakfast Recipes", it will show as following

	1. Dosa recipe
	2. Pongal recipe
	3. Idli recipe
	4. Upma recipe
 To view the above recipes, we need to click the picture under the headings.

Contact

	In the "Contact" link, you will find a form to fill out the information of name, email and address.
It will check user's email is correct or not if you submit the form.  

I hope you understand about my project.  Thank you for reading!!


Features Included:
--------------------------
CSS Features List
------------------	  

	1.  A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, that means
the navigation menu such as 
		Home
		Recipes
		Contact
will expand vertically for the mobile size and horizontally for the desktop size.  For that I have included 3 media queries such as
max-width: 769px, min-width: 769px and min-width: 1025 px in the file "style.css".

	2. I have used flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile and desktop views. I have included 2 media queries for flexbox
to swap from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.  Which is included in the file "flexbox.css"

	3. CSS Animation:
		I have used CSS animation for the logo "Mimi's Kitchen" to move from left to right and vice versa.  I have included in the file
"animation2.css"

Javascript Features
-------------------

	1. Created a form (‘Contact’ form in the Contact link), validated email address is in the proper format, 
and then use that information on the page and display it back to the user.  Also I have included an alert message to verify the email address.
