			<h3>About MIMI'S KITCHEN</h3>
			<p>I am doing a Front-End Web Development course in Code Lousiville.  In the course, I have a task to create a project which should includes the languages <strong>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</strong>.  So I thought about my passion in cooking and also wanted to store all my recipes at one place
					which I learned from my mom and friends.  So I started making this blog.
					The name MIMI's KITCHEN was suggested by my younger boy.</p>

		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>I am so glad you are here.  This is MIMI'S KITCHEN, our family food recipes blog.</p>
		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hello I am Menaka Hariharasuthan. I am originally from Tirunelveli, Papanasam (TamilNadu, Southern part of India). 
			When I was a young kid I was always interested to work in Kitchen and cooking.  Also I used to help my mom to make masala using olden model
			mortar and pestal which need lot of handwork.  My mom always uses freshly ground incredients for the cooking. She always cook freshly for everyday meal.  I started learning more 
			and more recipes and soon enough whenever my relatives visited our home for festivals I started cooking for them.  
			I finished my studies in Tamilnadu, India.  I did my Bachelor's in Mathematics and did Masters in Computer Applications.  
			I married to Harihara suthan.  Now I am in Louisville, Kentucky, USA with my husband and two boys.
